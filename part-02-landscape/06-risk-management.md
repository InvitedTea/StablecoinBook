# Chapter 6: Risk Management: Enterprise Framework for Stablecoin Adoption

Lisa Martinez, Chief Risk Officer at a $4.2B manufacturing company, faced a familiar challenge when her treasury team proposed stablecoin adoption: "We need to evaluate risks that don't fit our traditional banking risk framework." After six months of analysis, her team developed a comprehensive stablecoin risk management framework that addressed technology, operational, regulatory, and financial risks through systematic identification, measurement, and mitigation strategies.

"The key insight," Lisa reflected, "was that stablecoin risks are manageable and measurable—but they require new frameworks because traditional banking risk models don't capture the unique characteristics of blockchain-based financial infrastructure."

This systematic approach to stablecoin risk management enables enterprises to capture operational benefits while maintaining prudent risk management standards.

## Enterprise Risk Management Context

Stablecoin adoption requires enterprise risk managers to evaluate novel risks that don't map directly to traditional financial services risk categories. However, the fundamental principles of enterprise risk management—identification, assessment, mitigation, and monitoring—apply effectively to stablecoin evaluation.

### Risk Management Hierarchy

**Level 1: Strategic Risk**
- Business model impact of stablecoin adoption

- Staff training and capability development requirements
- System integration and technology deployment
- Vendor relationship management and oversight

**Level 3: Financial Risk**
- Counterparty exposure to stablecoin issuers
- Market risk from price volatility or depegging events
- Liquidity risk from redemption or conversion constraints
- Credit risk from reserve quality or issuer financial condition

**Level 4: Compliance Risk**
- Regulatory uncertainty and changing requirements
- AML/KYC compliance in new operational environment
